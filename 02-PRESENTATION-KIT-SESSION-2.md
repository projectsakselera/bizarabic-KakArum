### **SLIDE 6: CULTURAL CONCEPT - TAKARRUB (تقرب)**

**Title:**
Takarrub: The Art of Drawing Closer

</div>

**Takarrub** (تقرب) = Drawing closer, building personal connection

- Showing genuine interest in the person
- Building trust before discussing deals

### **SLIDE 7: THE COFFEE RITUAL**

**Title:**
Arabic Coffee - More Than a Drink
القهوة العربية - أكثر من مجرد مشروب

**The Ritual:**

**Step 1**: Host offers coffee in small cup (no handle)
**Step 2**: Guest accepts with right hand, says شكراً
**Step 3**: Guest drinks (3-5 sips—it's strong!)
**Step 4**: Host refills
**Step 5**: When guest is done, gently shake cup side-to-side
**Step 6**: Host stops pouring, takes cup

**Cultural Significance:**
- Offering coffee = "You are welcome; I respect you"
- Accepting = "I trust you; I'm open to connection"
- Multiple cups = "I'm comfortable; I want to stay"

**Business Tip:**
ALWAYS accept at least the first cup. Refusing is considered rude!

ماشاء الله، مكتبك جميل جداً
</div>
Ma sha' Allah, your office is very beautiful

✅ **Correct:**
<div dir="rtl">
ماشاء الله، عائلتك رائعة
</div>
Ma sha' Allah, your family is wonderful

❌ **Incorrect:**

**Script:**

"Assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh! السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته.

And let me be clear: In Arab business culture, small talk is NOT 'small.' It's **everything**. It's how trust is built, how partnerships are formed, and how deals get done.

Over the next two hours, we're going to explore:
- How to engage in culturally appropriate small talk
- The spiritual and cultural importance of relationships
- Practical phrases you can use immediately
- The fine line between personal and professional

Ready to become masters of connection? Let's go!"

**Delivery Tips:**

### **SLIDE 2: SPIRITUAL REFLECTION** (2 minutes)

**Script:**

"Before we dive into tactics and phrases, let's ground ourselves spiritually.

Listen to this beautiful hadith:

[Read in Arabic slowly]:
**'من كان يؤمن بالله واليوم الآخر فليكرم ضيفه'**
(Man kana yu'minu billahi wal-yawm al-akhir falyukrim dayfahu)

[Then English]:
**'Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should honor his guest.'**
(Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim)

This is profound. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is connecting **faith** with **hospitality**. He's saying that how you treat people—especially guests—is a direct reflection of your belief in Allah.

Think about what this means for us as business professionals. When you meet a Saudi partner, they're not just a client or a counterpart—they're a **guest**. And honoring that guest is an act of worship.

This is why Arabs spend so much time on small talk, on offering coffee, on making sure you're comfortable. It's not inefficient—it's **spiritual**.

In Arab culture, we call this **كرم** (karam)—generosity, hospitality. It's one of the highest virtues.

**Reflection for ESQ**: At ESQ, we talk about *akhlaq* (good character) and *ihsan* (excellence). When we practice genuine hospitality and build real connections, we're embodying these values.

**Question for you**: How can we show *karam* to our Saudi partners? Not just through words, but through our presence, our patience, our genuine interest?

[Pause 5 seconds for reflection]

Keep this hadith in mind today. Every phrase we learn, every cultural insight—it all comes back to honoring the person in front of you."

**Delivery Tips:**
- Slow, reflective pace
- Make it personal
- Connect to ESQ values explicitly

---

### **SLIDE 3: RECAP SESSION 1** (1 minute)

**Script:**

"Alright, quick recap! Who can tell me—what did we learn in Session 1?

[Point to slide, encourage answers]:

✅ The Arabic alphabet—28 letters, including those special throat sounds like ع and ح
✅ Business greetings—السلام عليكم being the most important
✅ The 6-step self-introduction structure
✅ Cultural importance of using titles—أستاذ، دكتور

Excellent! You've built a strong foundation.

**Now, here's the thing:** Introductions get you in the door. But small talk is what gets you **through** the door and into a real relationship.

Today, we're leveling up. We're moving from 'Hello, my name is...' to 'Tell me about your family. How was your journey? Let me offer you coffee.'

This is where business relationships are actually formed."

**Delivery Tips:**
- Quick pace (just 1 minute)
- Interactive—ask for volunteers
- Build excitement for Session 2

---

### **SLIDE 4: TODAY'S LEARNING OBJECTIVES** (1 minute)

**Script:**

"Here's what you'll be able to DO by the end of today:

[Point to each objective]:

**First**: You'll conduct culturally appropriate small talk. Not just any small talk—small talk that shows you understand Arab values and customs.

**Second**: You'll ask about health and family in a way that's respectful and appropriate. There's an art to this, especially with gender considerations.

**Third**: You'll express gratitude and good wishes using beautiful Arabic phrases that go beyond 'thank you.'

**Fourth**: You'll understand **تقرب** (takarrub)—the concept of 'drawing closer'—and how to practice it strategically.

**Fifth**: You'll navigate the line between personal and professional. Where's the boundary? How do you know when you've crossed it?

These skills will transform your business relationships in Saudi Arabia. Let's get started!"

**Delivery Tips:**
- Confident, clear
- Emphasize practical application
- Show enthusiasm

---

### **SLIDE 5: WHY SMALL TALK MATTERS** (3 minutes)

**Script:**

"Let me show you something that might shock you.

[Point to comparison table]:

Look at these two approaches to business meetings:

**Western approach**: Meeting starts. Quick greeting. Jump into agenda. Discuss business. Make decision. Done. 30-60 minutes total.

**Arab approach**: Meeting starts. Extended greeting. Coffee is served. Small talk for 30-60 minutes—'How are you? How's your family? How was your flight? Tell me about your work in Indonesia.' THEN, after trust is established, you discuss business. Maybe make a decision. Maybe need another meeting. Total time: 90-180 minutes, often multiple meetings.

Now, here's the question: Which approach is 'wasting time'?

[Pause for effect]

From a Western perspective, the Arab approach seems inefficient. But here's the truth: In Arab culture, **the small talk IS the productive part**. Because you're not just negotiating a deal—you're building a **relationship**. And in Saudi Arabia, people do business with people they **trust** and **like**.

Think about it: Would you rather have a 50-page legal contract with someone you don't trust? Or a handshake agreement with someone who's become your friend?

Arabs choose the latter. Every time.

**This is why small talk matters.** It's not fluff. It's the foundation of everything that comes after.

**For our ESQ team**: Adjust your expectations. Budget more time. And most importantly, don't see extended small talk as inefficient—see it as an investment in a lasting partnership."

**Delivery Tips:**
- Use dramatic pause after "Which is wasting time?"
- Show respect for both approaches (not judgmental)
- Make it relatable with examples

---

### **SLIDE 6: CULTURAL CONCEPT - TAKARRUB** (3 minutes)

**Script:**

"Now let me introduce you to one of the most important concepts in Arab business culture: **تقرب** (takarrub).

[Write on screen/whiteboard if possible]: ت ق ر ب

This comes from the Arabic root meaning 'to draw near' or 'to approach.'

**Takarrub** means **intentionally drawing closer** to someone—building a personal connection that goes beyond surface-level interaction.

In business context, takarrub is the strategic process of:
- Finding common ground
- Showing genuine interest in the other person
- Creating emotional rapport
- Building trust through personal connection

**How do Arabs practice takarrub?**

[Point to slide]:
- They ask about your health—genuinely wanting to know
- They ask about your family—showing they see you holistically
- They share personal stories—creating intimacy
- They look for mutual connections—'Do you know so-and-so?'
- They offer hospitality—coffee, food, warmth

All of this is **takarrub**. They're not just making conversation—they're intentionally creating a bond.

**And here's the key**: Takarrub must be **genuine**. Arabs can sense when it's fake. If you're just going through the motions to 'get to business,' they'll feel it. But if you're genuinely interested in them as a person? That's when magic happens.

**For ESQ team**: Practice takarrub by:
- Researching your partner's background before meeting
- Asking thoughtful, specific questions
- Listening more than you speak
- Finding shared values—faith, family, education, service

When you practice takarrub, you transform strangers into trusted partners.
